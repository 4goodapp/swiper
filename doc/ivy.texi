Ivy manual, version 0.7.0

Ivy is an interactive interface for completion in Emacs. Emacs uses
completion mechanism in a variety of contexts: code, menus, commands,
variables, functions, etc. Completion entails listing, sorting,
filtering, previewing, and applying actions on selected items. When
active, @code{ivy-mode} completes the selection process by narrowing
available choices while previewing in the minibuffer. Selecting the
final candidate is either through simple keyboard character inputs or
through powerful regular expressions.

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Ivy is for quick and easy selection from a list. When Emacs prompts
for a string from a list of several possible choices, Ivy springs into
action to assist in narrowing and picking the right string from a vast
number of choices.

Ivy strives for minimalism, simplicity, customizability and
discoverability.

@subsubheading Minimalism
     Uncluttered minibuffer is minimalism. Ivy shows the completion
defaults, the number of matches, and 10 candidate matches below
the input line. Customize @code{ivy-length} to adjust the number of
candidate matches displayed in the minibuffer.


@subsubheading Simplicity
     Simplicity is about Ivy's behavior in the minibuffer. It is also
about the code interface to extend Ivy's functionality. The
minibuffer area behaves as close to @code{fundamental-mode} as
possible. @kbd{SPC} inserts a space, for example, instead of being
bound to the more complex @code{minibuffer-complete-word}. Ivy's code
uses easy-to-examine global variables; avoids needless
complications with branch-introducing custom macros.


@subsubheading Customizability
     Customizability is about being able to use different methods and
interfaces of completion to tailor the selection process. For
example, adding a custom display function that points to a
selected candidate with @code{->}, instead of highlighting the
selected candidate with the @code{ivy-current-match} face. Or take the
customization of actions, say after the candidate function is
selected. @kbd{RET} uses @code{counsel-describe-function} to describe the
function, whereas @kbd{M-o d} jumps to that function's definition in
the code. The @kbd{M-o} prefix can be uniformly used with characters
like @kbd{d} to group similar actions.


@subsubheading Discoverability
     Ivy displays easily discoverable commands through the hydra
facility.  @kbd{C-o} in the minibuffer displays a hydra menu. It
opens up within an expanded minibuffer area. Each menu item comes
with short documentation strings and highlighted one-key
completions. So discovering even seldom used keys is simply a
matter of @kbd{C-o} in the minibuffer while in the midst of the Ivy
interaction. This discoverability minimizes exiting Ivy interface
for documentation look-ups.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Install Ivy automatically through Emacs's package manager, or manually
from Ivy's development repository.

@node Installing from Emacs Package Manager
@section Installing from Emacs Package Manager

@kbd{M-x} @code{package-install} @kbd{RET} @code{swiper} @kbd{RET}

Ivy is installed as part of @code{swiper} package. @code{swiper} is available
from two different package archives, GNU ELPA and MELPA. For the
latest stable version, use the GNU ELPA archives using the above M-x
command.

For current hourly builds, use the MELPA archives. See the code below
for adding MELPA to the list of package archives:

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
@end lisp

After this do @kbd{M-x} @code{package-refresh-contents} @kbd{RET}, followed by
@kbd{M-x} @code{package-install} @kbd{RET} @code{swiper} @kbd{RET}.

For package manager details, see @ref{Packages,,,emacs,}.

@node Installing from the Git repository

@section Minibuffer key bindings

Ivy includes several minibuffer bindings, which are defined in the
@code{ivy-minibuffer-map} keymap variable. The most frequently used ones
are described here.

@code{swiper} or @code{counsel-M-x} add more through the @code{keymap} argument to
@code{ivy-read}. These keys, also active in the minibuffer, are described
under their respective commands.

@item
@kbd{C-p} (@code{ivy-previous-line}) selects the previous candidate

@end itemize


@defopt ivy-wrap
This user option allows to get the wrap-around behavior for @kbd{C-n}
and @kbd{C-p}.  When set to @code{t}, @code{ivy-next-line} and
@code{ivy-previous-line} will cycle past the last and the first
candidates respectively.

This behavior is off by default.
@end defopt

@defopt ivy-height
Use this variable to adjust the minibuffer height, and therefore
the scroll size for @kbd{C-v} and @kbd{M-v}.
@end defopt

@node Key bindings for single selection action then exit minibuffer
@subsection Key bindings for single selection, action, then exit minibuffer

Ivy can offer several actions from which to choose which action to
run. This "calling an action" operates on the selected candidate. For
example, when viewing a list of files, one action could open it for
editing, one to view it, another to invoke a special function, and so
on. Custom actions can be added to this interface. The precise action
to call on the selected candidate can be delayed until after the
narrowing is completed. No need to exit the interface if unsure which
action to run. This delayed flexibility and customization of actions
extends usability of lists in Emacs.

@subsubheading @kbd{C-m} or @kbd{RET} (@code{ivy-done})
     Calls the default action and exits the minibuffer.


@subsubheading @kbd{M-o} (@code{ivy-dispatching-done})
     Presents all available valid actions from which to choose. When
there is only one action available, there is no difference
between @kbd{M-o} and @kbd{C-m}.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-j} (@code{ivy-alt-done})
     When completing file names, selects the current directory
candidate and starts a new completion session there. Otherwise,
it's the same as @code{ivy-done}.


@subsubheading @kbd{TAB} (@code{ivy-partial-or-done})
     Attempts partial completion, extending current input as much as
possible. @kbd{TAB TAB} is the same as @kbd{C-j}.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-M-j} (@code{ivy-immediate-done})
     Exits with @emph{the current input} instead of @emph{the current candidate}
(like other commands).

This is useful e.g. when you call @code{find-file} to create a new
file, but the desired name matches an existing file. In that
case, using @kbd{C-j} would select that existing file, which isn't
what you want - use this command instead.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-'} (@code{ivy-avy})
     Uses avy to select one of the candidates on the current candidate
page.  This can often be faster than multiple @kbd{C-n} or @kbd{C-p}
keystrokes followed by @kbd{C-m}.

@node Key bindings for multiple selections and actions keep minibuffer open
@subsection Key bindings for multiple selections and actions, keep minibuffer open

For repeatedly applying multiple actions or acting on multiple
candidates, Ivy does not close the minibuffer between commands. It
keeps the minibuffer open for applying subsequent actions.

Adding an extra meta key to the normal key chord invokes the special
version of the regular commands that enables applying multiple
actions.

@subsubheading @kbd{C-M-m} (@code{ivy-call})
     Is the non-exiting version of @kbd{C-m} (@code{ivy-done}).

Instead of closing the minibuffer, @kbd{C-M-m} allows selecting
another candidate or another action. For example, @kbd{C-M-m} on
functions list invokes @code{describe-function}. When combined with
@kbd{C-n}, function descriptions can be invoked quickly in
succession.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-M-o} (@code{ivy-dispatching-call})
     Is the non-exiting version of @kbd{M-o} (@code{ivy-dispatching-done}).

For example, during the @code{counsel-rhythmbox} completion, press
@kbd{C-M-o e} to en-queue the selected candidate, followed by @kbd{C-n
     C-m} to play the next candidate - the current action reverts to
the default one after @kbd{C-M-o}.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-M-n} (@code{ivy-next-line-and-call})
     Combines @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-M-m}. Applies an action and moves to next
line.

Comes in handy when opening multiple files from
@code{counsel-find-file}, @code{counsel-git-grep}, @code{counsel-ag}, or
@code{counsel-locate} lists. Just hold @kbd{C-M-n} for rapid-fire default
action on each successive element of the list.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-M-p} (@code{ivy-previous-line-and-call})
     Combines @kbd{C-p} and @kbd{C-M-m}.

Similar to the above except it moves through the list in the
other direction.


@subsubheading @code{ivy-resume}
     Recalls the state of the completion session just before its last exit.

Useful after an accidental @kbd{C-m} (@code{ivy-done}).

@node Key bindings that alter the minibuffer input
@subsection Key bindings that alter the minibuffer input

@subsubheading @kbd{M-n} (@code{ivy-next-history-element})
     Cycles forward through the Ivy command history.

Ivy updates an internal history list after each action. When this
history list is empty, @kbd{M-n} inserts symbol (or URL) at point
into the minibuffer.


@subsubheading @kbd{M-p} (@code{ivy-previous-history-element})
     Cycles forward through the Ivy command history.


@subsubheading @kbd{M-i} (@code{ivy-insert-current})
     Inserts the current candidate into the minibuffer.

Useful for copying and renaming files, for example: @kbd{M-i} to
insert the original file name string, edit it, and then @kbd{C-m} to
complete the renaming.


@subsubheading @kbd{M-j} (@code{ivy-yank-word})
     Inserts the sub-word at point into the minibuffer.

This is similar to @kbd{C-s C-w} with @code{isearch}. Ivy reserves @kbd{C-w}
for @code{kill-region}.


@subsubheading @kbd{S-SPC} (@code{ivy-restrict-to-matches})
     Deletes the current input, and resets the candidates list to the
currently restricted matches.

This is how Ivy provides narrowing in successive tiers.


@subsubheading @kbd{C-r} (@code{ivy-reverse-i-search})
     Starts a recursive completion session through the command's
history.

This works just like @kbd{C-r} at the bash command prompt, where the
completion candidates are the history items. Upon completion, the
selected candidate string is inserted into the minibuffer.

@node Other key bindings
@subsection Other key bindings

@subsubheading @kbd{M-w} (@code{ivy-kill-ring-save})
     Copies selected candidates to the kill ring.

When the region is active, copies active region instead.

@node Hydra in the minibuffer
@subsection Hydra in the minibuffer

@subsubheading @kbd{C-o} (@code{hydra-ivy/body})
     Invokes the hydra menu with short key bindings.

Minibuffer editing is disabled when Hydra is active. Instead, you get
short aliases for the common commands:

@multitable {aaaaa} {aaaaaaaaa} {aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}
@headitem Short
@tab Normal
@tab Command name
@item @kbd{o}
@tab @kbd{C-g}
@tab @code{keyboard-escape-quit}
@item @kbd{j}
@tab @kbd{C-n}
@tab @code{ivy-next-line}
@item @kbd{k}
@tab @kbd{C-p}
@tab @code{ivy-previous-line}
@item @kbd{h}
@tab @kbd{M-<}
@tab @code{ivy-beginning-of-buffer}
@item @kbd{l}
@tab @kbd{M->}
@tab @code{ivy-end-of-buffer}
@item @kbd{d}
@tab @kbd{C-m}
@tab @code{ivy-done}
@item @kbd{f}
@tab @kbd{C-j}
@tab @code{ivy-alt-done}
@item @kbd{g}
@tab @kbd{C-M-m}
@tab @code{ivy-call}
@item @kbd{u}
@tab @kbd{C-c C-o}
@tab @code{ivy-occur}
@end multitable

Hydra reduces key strokes, for example: @kbd{C-n C-n C-n C-n} is @kbd{C-o
jjjj} in Hydra.

Additionally, you get access to the folowing commands that are
normally not bound:

@subsubheading @kbd{c} (@code{ivy-toggle-calling})
     Toggle calling the action after each candidate change. This
effectively modifies @kbd{j} to @kbd{jg}, @kbd{k} to @kbd{kg} etc.


@subsubheading @kbd{m} (@code{ivy-toggle-fuzzy})
     Toggle the current regexp matcher.


@subsubheading @kbd{>} (@code{ivy-minibuffer-grow})
     Increase @code{ivy-height} for the current minibuffer.


@subsubheading @kbd{<} (@code{ivy-minibuffer-shrink})
     Decrease @code{ivy-height} for the current minibuffer.


@subsubheading @kbd{w} (@code{ivy-prev-action})
     Select the previous action.


@subsubheading @kbd{s} (@code{ivy-next-action})
     Select the next action.


@subsubheading @kbd{a} (@code{ivy-read-action})
     Use a menu to select an action.


@subsubheading @kbd{C} (@code{ivy-toggle-case-fold})
     Toggle case folding (matching both upper and lower case
characters with lower case input).

@node Saving the current completion session to a buffer
@subsection Saving the current completion session to a buffer

@subsubheading @kbd{C-c C-o} (@code{ivy-occur})
     Saves the current candidates to a new buffer and exits
completion.

The new buffer is read-only and has a few useful bindings defined.

@subsubheading @kbd{RET} or @kbd{j} (@code{ivy-occur-press})
     Call the current action on the selected candidate.


@subsubheading @kbd{mouse-1} (@code{ivy-occur-click})
     Call the current action on the selected candidate.


@subsubheading @kbd{j} (@code{next-line})
     Move to next line.


@subsubheading @kbd{k} (@code{previous-line})
     Move to previous line.


@subsubheading @kbd{a} (@code{ivy-occur-read-action})
     Read an action and make it current for this buffer.


@subsubheading @kbd{o} (@code{ivy-occur-dispatch})
     Read an action and call it on the selected candidate.


@subsubheading @kbd{q} (@code{quit-window})
     Bury the current buffer.


Ivy has no limit on the number of active buffers like these.

Ivy takes care of making these buffer names unique. It applies
descriptive names, for example: @code{*ivy-occur counsel-describe-variable
"function$*}.

@node Completion styles
@chapter Completion styles

Ivy's completion functions rely on the highly configurable regex
builder.

The default is:
@lisp
(setq ivy-re-builders-alist
      '((t . ivy--regex-plus)))
@end lisp

The default @code{ivy--regex-plus} narrowing is always invoked unless
specified otherwise. For example, file name completion may have a
custom completion function:
@lisp
(setq ivy-re-builders-alist
      '((read-file-name-internal . ivy--regex-fuzzy)
        (t . ivy--regex-plus)))
@end lisp

Ivy's flexibility extends to using different styles of completion
mechanics (regex-builders) for different types of lists. Despite this
flexibility, Ivy operates within a consistent and uniform interface.
The main regex-builders currently in Ivy are:
@menu
* ivy--regex-plus::
* ivy--regex-ignore-order::
* ivy--regex-fuzzy::
@end menu

@node ivy--regex-plus
@section ivy--regex-plus

@code{ivy--regex-plus} is Ivy's default completion method.

@code{ivy--regex-plus} matches by splitting the input by spaces and
rebuilding it into a regex.

As the search string is typed in Ivy's minibuffer, it is transformed
into proper regex syntax. If the string is @code{"for example"}, it is
transformed into

@lisp
"\\(for\\).*\\(example\\)"
@end lisp

which in regex terminology matches @code{"for"} followed by a wild card and
then @code{"example"}. Note how Ivy uses the space character to build wild
cards. For literal white space matching in Ivy, use an extra space: to
match one space type two spaces, to match two spaces type three
spaces, and so on.

As Ivy transforms typed characters into regex strings, it provides an
intuitive feedback through font highlights.

Ivy supports regexp negation with @code{"!"}.
For example, @code{"define key ! ivy quit"} first selects everything
matching @code{"define.*key"}, then removes everything matching @code{"ivy"},
and finally removes everything matching @code{"quit"}. What remains is the
final result set of the negation regexp.

Since Ivy treats minibuffer input as a regexp, the standard regexp
identifiers work: @code{"^"}, @code{"$"}, @code{"\b"} or @code{"[a-z]"}. The exceptions
are spaces, which translate to @code{".*"}, and @code{"!"} that signal the
beginning of a negation group.

@node ivy--regex-ignore-order
@section ivy--regex-ignore-order

@code{ivy--regex-ignore-order} ignores the order of regexp tokens when
searching for matching candidates. For instance, the input
@code{"for example"} will match @code{"example test for"}.

@node ivy--regex-fuzzy
@section ivy--regex-fuzzy

@code{ivy--regex-fuzzy} splits each character with a wild card. Searching
for @code{"for"} returns all @code{"f.*o.*r"} matches, resulting in a large
number of hits.  Yet some searches need these extra hits. Ivy sorts
such large lists using @code{flx} package's scoring mechanism, if it's
installed.
